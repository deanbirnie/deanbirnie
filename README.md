##  &#x1F4D6; About Me
I am an aspiring software developer. I took an opportunity to follow my passion and have commited to the [ALX Software Engineering](https://https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/) course for 2023. I aim to increase my skillset throughout the year, adding not only new languages and tools to my repertoire but also focussing on improving efficiency and industry-related soft skills.
